*simple_bank* is a small project built with Golang, Postgres, and Docker. It is based on a series of [courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx6CPDK_5mU&list=PLy_6D98if3ULEtXtNSY_2qN21VCKgoQAE&pp=iAQB) and aims to create a minimal version of a bank, simulating the interaction between users, accounts, and their transfers.
